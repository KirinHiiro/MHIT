# This is a sample config file for MHIT_CL
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored
# empty lines are also ignored. So the next line is ignored.

# The "outputFile" tag defines where to store the output. If you ignore the 
# full path the output file is stored in the same location that MHIT_CL is
# executing.
outputFile = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\calculatedIndices.csv

# The output file could be also Excel file. Uncomment one of the following 
# to test writing to an Excel file. Your system should be able to write into
# Excel file. This usually means that you need to have Excel installed.
#outputFile = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\calculatedIndices.xls
#outputFile = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\calculatedIndices.xlsx

# The output could have an extension of txt or any other extension. If the
# extension is not .csv, .xls, or .xlsx the file is written as a 
# comma separated text file, regardless of the extension.
# Uncomment one of the following to test.
#outputFile = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\calculatedIndices.txt
#outputFile = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\calculatedIndices.MyUnknownExt


# The following tag defines the full path to the location 
# where drainage file is stored. If you ignore the full path it is assumed that
# the drainage file is located in the same location that MHIT_CL is executing.
drainageArea = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData\drainageArea.csv

# The following tag defines the directory where the data files are stored.
dataDirectory = F:\temporary\MHIT_SampleData

# The following tag defines the name pattern for data file. Any file in 
# "dataDirectory" that matches the following pattern is processed. So make
# sure that only data files match the following pattern. The exception is 
# the drainage file, defined by "drainageArea" and the output file defined 
# by "outputFile" above. These files are excluded from the list even if they
# match the provided pattern.
# The following pattern matches any file starting with "reach" and ending 
# with ".csv". For example "reach13639.csv" and "reach13640.csv".
dataFilenamePattern = reach*.csv

# The following defines number of parallel workers to be used.
# If there is already a MATAB parallel worker running, that running pool would
# be used and nParallelWorkers is ignored (unless if nParallelWorkers=0). 
# otherwise if:
# - - nParallelWorkers >= 1 -> a pool of parallel worker is started that 
#                              contains nParallelWorkers.
# - - nParallelWorkers = 0  -> data files are processed sequentially, even if
#                              there is already a MATLAB parallel pool available.
# - - nParallelWorkers = -1 -> A parallel pool is launched using the default 
#                              configurations (if there is no parallel pool available).
nParallelWorkers = 4

# GENERAL Notes:
# - - The order of above tags is not important. They can be provided in any
#     order, as long as they are all provided.
# - - The tags are not case sensitive; therefore, "outputFile", "OUTPUTFILE",
#     "OutPutFiLe" are all the same.
# - - Although the tags are not case sensitive, the filenames could be. If 
#     you are using a file system on Linux, or if you have enabled case on 
#     MAC OSX file system, the filenames are treated as case sensitive. On 
#     Windows the filenames are not case sensitive.
# - - The headers in the data file and drainage file are case sensitive. Refer
#     to the sample data that is provided on GitHub for example.
# - - the spaces around "=" are not needed.
# - - if one tag is defined multiple of times, the last value is used.
# - - if nParallelWorkers is omitted in the configuration file, it is assumed
#     that (nParallelWorkers = -1).
